# Sudoku
A basic sudoku game with three difficulties to choose from. The field gets created by a backtracking algorithm, ensuring that the riddle will be unique. 
Statistics can be displayed as well as a fun feature to play the norwegian or german anthem. The game tracks the time you use per riddle as well as the number of mistakes.
A maximum of three mistakes is allowed, after that the game ends. In addition, you can use a hint button to get a square filled in. In the settings the color of the
game field can be adjusted.
